## R Markdown

This is an implementation of Random Forest in R. The party package is used here with dataset readingSkills. The head() used here gives us the first 6 records.


```{r party}
install.packages("party")
library(party)
install.packages("randomForest")
library(randomForest)
```

##R Markdown 
The randomForest() function is used in R for implementing randomForest. The package reading skills used here has four columns nativeSpeakers, "age", shoeSize, and score. All are taken into consideration. 

```{r party}
r_forest <- randomForest(nativeSpeaker ~ age + shoeSize + score,data=readingSkills)
```

## Printing the result

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r party}
print(r_forest)
```
## Above result predicts the random forest in R.
